# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Data-Analysis
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
### In this project, I designed a dynamic and interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze hospital performance metrics. The goal was to provide hospital administrators and stakeholders with data-backed insights to drive decisions around:

#### Patient flow management
#### Doctor performance
#### Departmental efficiency
#### Revenue trends
#### Appointment and admission analytics
#### The analysis empowers healthcare institutions to deliver better patient outcomes, reduce bottlenecks, and improve overall operational efficiency.

## ðŸ“Š Key Dashboard Sections & Insights
### 1. Patient Demographics Dashboard
### Insights:
#### Majority of patients fall in the 30â€“39 age group, indicating demand for mid-age health services.
#### Gender distribution is nearly equal, with a slight male dominance.
#### High patient inflow from specific cities/regionsâ€”potential to expand branches there.

### 2. Appointments & Admissions Analysis
### Insights:
#### Thursday and Saturday see the highest number of appointments.
#### Most appointments are scheduled in the night between 10 PM â€“ 12 AM.
#### High no-show rates observed in evening slots.

### 3. Department-wise Performance
### Insights:
#### General Medicine and Orthopedics receive the highest patient visits.
#### Gastroenterology receive the less visited.

### ðŸ“ˆ Technologies Used
#### Power BI: For interactive dashboards and real-time insights
#### DAX Measures & Calculations: For dynamic KPIs like patient count, revenue, visit trends
#### Data Cleaning & Modeling: Performed within Power BIâ€™s Power Query Editor
